# Rawson Vue Test

## Instructions

Please review these carefully, both the final submitted code & how well these instructions are followed will be taken into consideration.

Your task is to create a view of Reddit's front-page using the following endpoint: [https://reddit.com/.json](https://reddit.com/.json).

* Clone this repository, then create your own public repository and set that as the remote (see: `git remote set-url`). This is so that other's can't see your work as they would if you were to fork the repository.
* Remove the existing `HelloWorld` component and replace it with your own (and any child components).
* Don't worry about authentication.
* Don't worry about styling, though if you'd like to you can use Bootstrap.
* Including some features in your component/s like being able to expand a post's body content inline, see the votes, awards etc would be good.
* Ensure that all the submitted code lints according to the `.eslintrc.js` specifications.
* Give yourself approx. 2 hours to complete the task.
